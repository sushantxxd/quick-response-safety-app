# Quick Response

## Overview
The **Emergency Service App** is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to provide rapid assistance during emergencies. It consists of two separate apps:
1. **User App** – Allows users to request emergency services.
2. **Service Provider App** – Enables responders to receive and manage emergency requests.

## Features
### User App
-  **Real-time Location Sharing** – Uses Google Maps API to pinpoint user locations.
-  **Emergency Request** – Users can request help with a single tap.
-  **Live Tracking** – Track responders in real-time.


### Service Provider App
-  **Receive Emergency Requests** – View user requests and navigate to their locations.
-  **Request Management** – Accept, decline, or mark requests as resolved.


## Tech Stack
